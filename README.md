# Bookbot

This project is a guided project I built from Boot.dev lessons.  
The purpose of this application is to parse the text of a book  
and print information to the terminal about word count and  
letter count.  

It is a very simple project whose purpose was mainly to practice
using an IDE and assembling projects that use multiple files and directories.

## Requirements

The latest version of Python3

## How To Use

Once the application is downloaded, from its root run:  
`python3 main.py <path_to_book>` where path_to_book is the filepath to the
.txt file containing the book you want to run through the functions.
